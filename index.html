<p>I&#8217;ve had to recreate most of my old blog posts and am doing a static export to github pages, so bear with me here! I was torn on what kind of cheesy hoodie image to use here, so I went full bore and stuck with Hackers the movie. It doesn&#8217;t hold a candle to Sneakers but that&#8217;s a debate for another time.</p>



<p>I took this <a href="https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/network-penetration-testing-ethical-hacking/">SANS SEC560 course</a> in person in NYC in Feb 2020, shortly after the world turned upside down. This review is super delayed, trying to recreate things here and play catch up. It was the last class I was able to take in person, or I guess the last trip of any sort of I took in person minus some family camping. So while it&#8217;s still fresh enough in my head, the last 18 months have felt like 18 years of what we&#8217;ve learned to semi-affectionately call COVID months which have felt somewhere between football minutes and full stoppage of time. </p>



<p>I was able to do this course through the SANS work study program, which I&#8217;ve detailed in my <a href="https://secdan.com/sans-sec504-gcih-class-and-work-study-review/">504 review here</a>, but I really do enjoy. Got to hang out with a lovely group of fellow nerds (and I mean that in the most complimentary way!) and get some much needed social time away from home. None of us realized at the time that we&#8217;d spend most of the next year at home of course. </p>



<p>My instructor was <a href="https://www.sans.org/profiles/jorge-orchilles/">Jorge Orchilles</a> who did a really fantastic job with a very upbeat, energetic teaching style that kept all of us engaged through some long days in class. We had a TA as well, Fred (who I can&#8217;t seem to find an instructor profile for), who swapped spots back and forth with Jorge so we got different perspectives on the same material and the both worked very well together and the feedback throughout the class was overall very positive. One part of doing the work study program involves doing all the ratings and reviews so you get a very first hand read on all the other students&#8217; experiences. </p>



<p>Overall, I really enjoyed the course. There was definitely some overlap in days 1 and 2 with recon and scanning with previous courses but to different degrees. Always good to get a refresh and some different points of view. As it got further into the week with exploitation and pivoting it was all new material which was very interesting content. </p>



<p>I&#8217;m looking over the current day 5 material, it looks like it&#8217;s slightly updated adding content on Azure. I&#8217;d love to have seen some of that in my class too, I can understand why they added it, as I&#8217;m deep into some Azure cleanup and security right now in my job and any material that shows that is helpful.</p>



<p>In true SANS course fashion, the day 6 CTF was a nail biter but a total blast. A group of people I had hung out with a lot, went to dinner with, were all set to have me as part of their CTF team but were full on the last day. Bummer as they were all professional pentesters! Needless to say, they beat everyone else to a well earned challenge coin but we came reasonably close and got to test out a lot of the attacks we had learned about during the week and had a ton of fun in the process. </p>



<p>Shortly after I took this class my workplace had a surprise red team engagement from our parent company. Most of the people involved in the many (MANY!) meetings that came out of that months long engagement really couldn&#8217;t follow most of the findings all that well. I felt this course gave me a much stronger position to understand the attacks, assist in the remediation and even test some of attacks that were used in order to validate that everyone was back in order after.</p>



<p>As I had the OnDemand course access this was really helpful to review everything after. We were in a stressful time right after the class ended and it would have been easy to just push everything to the side and try to focus on things like stockpiling toilet paper and shelf stable foods. It was nice to have a productive distraction then and good reinforcement of all the materials that are fire hosed at you for a week in class. </p>



<p>As I mentioned earlier, shortly after I got home, pretty much everything, everywhere, shut down. So I was unsure how I was going to be able to take my GPEN exam, fortunately within a few months the online proctor testing option became available. I&#8217;ve taken tests like that in college, and even an Azure exam more recently, but nothing where I had a whole stack of books. Definitely a different experience but I was glad to have the opportunity to take the exam even with everything shut down. As always, use your practice tests, they&#8217;re the same style as the real ones and extremely valuable in preparing for your real test. </p>



<p>But, proud to say, even sitting up in my 3rd floor tiny home office &#8220;testing center&#8221; I officially became GPEN certified! </p>



<p> This was an interesting course for me overall as I&#8217;m more a blue teamer than red, but I&#8217;ve been able to take on some purple responsibility at work and that&#8217;s been really satisfying to play a little bit of both. The one difference with this one is day to day I&#8217;m not actively pentesting, but developing the skill further after the class and trying to retain the skillset is definitely something you&#8217;re going to want to do. There are far more red than blue types of online labs so fortunately you don&#8217;t have to search far to find valuable content. </p>



<p>To keep up and later expand the skills I&#8217;d recommend checking out https://tryhackme.com/, they have paths you can follow with tons of content  in all sorts of different areas. Very much worth the $10 a month for a premium subscription. Also, can&#8217;t forget https://www.hackthebox.eu/ as well, they have a VIP subscription and now an academy model too but I don&#8217;t have personal experience with their training side so I can&#8217;t really give input on that one. </p>

<p>This is one of those topics that years ago I would have said you&#8217;re crazy to even consider being cool with being audited. I came up in IT through a pharma company and we&#8217;d get HIPAA audits and I&#8217;d have to sit silently next to our regulatory lawyer with a giant book. The other side of the table would ask questions and I&#8217;d whisper to the lawyer, who would translate it into regulatory&#8217;ese and then he&#8217;d share with the other side what he felt was OK for them to know. I learned to never tell an auditor more than they asked and they are under any circumstances not your friend.</p>



<p>Years later, I&#8217;m in security, and one way or another audit is a really common thing. We have to deal with PCI audits, QSA, etc, so while it&#8217;s a lot more lax than I remember the idea is stuck in my head that you never tell them more than they asked for and even then, scope the response so tightly that they can&#8217;t poke at it.</p>



<p>The first internal audit I was all braced to button up and try to stonewall the IA team. I sat next to the CIO who blasted them for even suggesting there were problems and I felt like, &#8220;hey, this is pretty much like I remember, lovely&#8230;&#8221; Then, after that super exciting experience I sat down with the auditors and they explained, they&#8217;re not trying to shut us down and fine us, they&#8217;re trying to help the company, the one they also work for. Nice people, I started to come around to the idea of not only working together, but being able to get some benefit in my team from the audit findings.</p>



<p>Well, months go by and I&#8217;m off to my <a href="https://secdan.com/sans-sec460-course-review-enterprise-threat-and-vulnerability-assessment/">SEC460 </a>class on vulnerability assessment and I come back all ready to tweak our internal scanning and vulnerability management process. We make some changes, we are spinning good reports in a bunch of different ways but the remediation part is still out of our hands. No matter how many ways we hand over the data, people just aren&#8217;t getting it. We have management buy in, but it&#8217;s just not going above the director level. People make excuses on why they can&#8217;t patch or change a config, or mostly just ignore it all.</p>



<p>So we have a few months of just beating our heads against that wall. And then, I hear that our parent company is going to order our IA team to audit our vulnerability management program. They started by bringing in a trainer to teach 20+ auditors how to audit network security. My boss at the time dropped a phone book (remember those?) sized book on my desk after and said she used it for the week long class and comprehended almost none of it. After who knows how much money they spent on training the staff, they realized they were far outside of their technical range and decided they were going to hire a 3rd party to do the scanning and assessment.</p>



<p>Why wouldn&#8217;t they just use the data we already had? Well, I work at one of the child companies of a larger international company and the parent org wanted all the child companies assessed equally and didn&#8217;t trust the individual inputs. After they burned an exotic super car worth of money hiring an outside firm that found less than we already were internally a few interesting things happened.</p>



<p>First internal audit was able to highlight that my team was doing pretty well in the assessing, and while they didn&#8217;t want to admit it, we were doing better than the outside company. It&#8217;s not even a brag, we just know our own environment better than they do. But, the most important finding was that they were able to highlight that the issue wasn&#8217;t the security team not finding the problems, we had tons of records for that, but that the other teams weren&#8217;t remediating the problems.</p>



<p>I walked into an audit meeting with some people far (faaaaar!) above my pay grade who acted very shocked about the reports they were seeing and I was glad to point out that none of this should have been a surprise to them. It seems there was someone along the chain who didn&#8217;t want the Sr management to know about the problem, so the higher level support just wasn&#8217;t happening.</p>



<p>Suddenly, the idea that these results were going to the board was terrifying for people. I had told them for a long time, but they got used to tuning me out and without a hammer big enough to make people fix things, the most I can do is keep escalating but that only works so much. Sure, they would patch PCI scoped items, but outside of that there was zero fear of consequence of not doing the right thing.</p>



<p>That CIO who was yelling at the auditors in the first meeting, he was silent. Afterwards we were told &#8220;this all needs to be fixed, I need to know what it&#8217;s going to take!&#8221; Out of nowhere we had resources, because it wasn&#8217;t the security guy telling them there was a problem, it was the audit committee (and in turn the board) who was telling them.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t want to say a few teams were given a blank check to clean up, but this added push went further than anything else we had tried before. This year, on one of our fundraising days, I came back to my desk to find a bunch of candy, from the internal audit team, for being so helpful to their work. Talk about a change I never would have anticipated happening a few years ago!</p>
