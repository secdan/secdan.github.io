<p>Phishing is a thing most of us are painfully familiar with day to day. It&#8217;s fairly well understood to be the easiest and most common path to a breach. So why is it so easy? It&#8217;s simple, people don&#8217;t pay attention to what they&#8217;re doing most of work day. Is that to say that very complex phishing attempts would fool almost anyone? Of course they would, but, I&#8217;ve been doing phishing testing at my company for the last few years and in practice it&#8217;s far less complex than most people realize.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve worked with a few phishing testing and awareness training vendors, I have books on game theory and social engineering. But, I could make a simple email with the wrong company domain, with a giant tag across the top of the email saying &#8220;This is from external contact, please be cautious of clicking links or opening attachment, WARNING!!&#8221; and fill the body out with a misspelled request to validate your password at crapsite.co.com.xxx.guru/fake-password-stealer.html and I&#8217;ll still get 10%+ of the users handing over their passwords within an hour. Insert mental image of me facepalming myself at my desk here.</p>



<p>They all get awareness training, we run testing campaigns with education, we have security awareness week with fun prizes. But, once they&#8217;re out of that bubble, it&#8217;s a click party. Even following up with reports from our email security provider for phishing that does get through you can ask the users and they&#8217;ll say, &#8220;but that&#8217;s a vendor of mine&#8221;. When you pull up the email, it&#8217;s nothing close to anyone they deal with, doesn&#8217;t matter, clicking anyway.</p>



<p>Considering you might really only need one person to click and give away credentials / load your malware / etc, how do you really solve this? If I knew how to get this number down to zero without smashing email servers with a hammer I wouldn&#8217;t be writing a blog post, I&#8217;d be swimming in my Scrooge McDuck money bin.</p>



<p>How about aiming a little lower? While it pains me to write that, understand it&#8217;s never going to be perfect and just aim for better than yesterday, and eventually, not worse than yesterday. There are some technical controls, but as long as users can get emails from outside, you&#8217;re likely going to deal with this problem, forget it coming from a real vendor that has been compromised, that&#8217;s another ball of wax entirely.</p>



<p>Ideas that have been helpful for me:</p>



<ul>
<li>Banners for external mail</li>
<li>More training</li>
<li>Sharing stories of actual cases</li>
<li>Simply the reporting process</li>
<li>Positive reinforcement</li>
<li>Consequences</li>
</ul>



<p>A little more detail on the above ideas:</p>



<ul>
<li>Banners for external mail &#8211; I touched on this earlier but basically have any email that isn&#8217;t sourced internally from your domain to be tagged with some sort of obvious external tag. Will some people ignore it? Sure they will, but some won&#8217;t, and if you solve a little bit at a time it does add up.</li>
<li>More training &#8211; Training needs to be interesting and engaging, if all the users have to do is click next 5x and they&#8217;re done for the year. If that&#8217;s the case you might pass compliance but you&#8217;re no more secure than you were before the training.</li>
<li>Sharing stories of actual cases &#8211; This one didn&#8217;t even occur to me until I was running a tabletop exercise recently and someone from outside IT had the suggestion. They felt through the tabletop they were learning so much and had no idea how real the threats were. Make the stories somewhat generic if you need to so people don&#8217;t get mocked, and don&#8217;t be afraid to share good stories of users catching crafty emails. Everyone loves a pat on the back, we did this recently and sent out a company-wide email newsletter with details and got a lot of positive feedback.</li>
<li>Simplifying the reporting process &#8211; If a user has a questionable email, how hard is it for them to ask for some help? If they have to call up and admit they made a mistake they are less likely to do it. If they email it to the help desk and never hear back, expect them to never do it again. Many phishing providers (they are also free ones out there) make buttons for most email clients that allow users a one button click to send an email in to be inspected. Bonus points if they click it during a real phishing test and it doesn&#8217;t bother creating the ticket and congratulates the user for a good catch.</li>
<li>Positive reinforcement &#8211; There is a bit of this sprinkled into the earlier suggestions. But, if people know they can come to you, even if they&#8217;ve clicked and think they&#8217;ve done something wrong, it&#8217;s going to go a lot further in building a relationship and having them learn the right thing than just yelling at them for mistakes. Some people use different types of rewards, know your own company and market and figure out what works, but even just thanking people for reporting issues can work wonders.</li>
<li>Consequences &#8211; More in the stick than the carrot category, hash consequences for your actions. Not really my favorite way to approach it, but if I have someone who has done training repeatedly, been talked to, explained how it all works and still clicks on everything that is put in front of them, then sometimes you have to work your way up the org chart a bit. I once saw another business unit&#8217;s HR staff fell for a phish and sent all their employee&#8217;s W2s out via email. The user was fired. I found out and immediately went to &#8220;was she trained?&#8221; or even &#8220;why was the email able to be spoofed and passed through?&#8221; line of thought. Extreme consequence, but you can bet that every other person in that department was hawk eyed afterwards. Not my preferred method but that one was far out of my hands.</li>
</ul>



<p>I think with any testing you should start simple and grow towards way more complicated with time. Anyone can design a perfect phish that will work on exactly who you target. But, is there a point of it being too difficult? That&#8217;s hard to say, but we recently switched phishing providers and they wanted to do a baseline test. As part of this test they got our internal domain spoofed, which we block normally anyway, and a whitelist which bypassed the external banners. Not surprisingly they got a higher than normal click rate. But, they tweaked the controls enough to present something to the users that normally wasn&#8217;t even possible. They were trained to look at the real domain, the external banner, etc, they did that correctly and then were informed they were wrong. Thankfully that was just a small test and we were able to revert the changes and go for a close lookalike domain and put the banner back on. The results were lower, not as low as I&#8217;d like, but at least controlling the situation got a more predictable result.</p>



<p>I was once told by an old Cisco SE about an internal phishing test that got him, and I can&#8217;t blame him. He was at work, shopping on Amazon and purchased something. Seconds after the purchase he got a purchase confirmation email from Amazon. They were monitoring the network for specific traffic and triggering phishing emails to those users based on that. He had clicked on the email before it even registered that his work email wasn&#8217;t his registered Amazon account address. But, in a situation like this, just playing the odds, it could happen anyway that you&#8217;ll have a user at a giant corp shopping Amazon at the moment. A few years back I sent out a phishing test email with one of the &#8220;You hit your email quota, click here to increase your mailbox size and continue getting email&#8221; sort of message. It was sent to maybe 6000 users, two of them had actually put in requests to have their real mailbox size increased already and were waiting for the update. You can bet they clicked that link the second that test showed up, I had no idea it would work out that way, but it doesn&#8217;t seem all that unlikely.</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t updated in a while, but I wanted to focus on knocking out the GCIH after the course and had a ton of other things going on, so, here you go. I&#8217;ll try to make up for it with an annoying amount of detail.</p>



<p>The SANS SEC504 &#8211;&nbsp;Hacker Tools, Techniques, Exploits, and Incident Handling (https://www.sans.org/course/hacker-techniques-exploits-incident-handling) is the most recent SANS course I&#8217;ve taken, and the first time I&#8217;ve taken one in person. Drinking from the firehose in person is very different from watching the OnDemand at home, overall great experience.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m in no way a stranger to different types of education. I&#8217;ve done a bunch of classes in different topics, have a BS, a few classes into an MS, have done a pile of self-study certifications, and nothing compared to the experience of a 6 days on-site SANS course. Let&#8217;s just say I slept well that week!</p>



<p>Taking a few steps back, I work in infosec and my department is not exactly what I would consider well-staffed. Because of that, I (along with many others in my field I&#8217;m sure) have to wear many different hats. Incident response is just one of the tasks that is on my plate and what I&#8217;ve done so far has been just what seemed like a logical process. I&#8217;ve heard John Strand mention the PICERLL model many times on podcasts but didn&#8217;t spend a lot of time digging into it otherwise. Most of my experience is on the blue team side so this class was right down my alley!</p>



<p>My current workplace is pretty free with training time, but, training funds&#8230; not so much. Because of that I&#8217;ve been applying to the SANS Work Study program (https://www.sans.org/work-study/) and this was the first time the event date, class and location all worked together and I was all in. For those not familiar with the program, you essentially agree to work the live event as a facilitator in exchange for a huge discount on the training and exam. You show up a day or so early, do a bunch of setup, bundle together training materials, get promotional stuff ready. But overall, it was nice just hanging out with people in the field, talking about nerdy infosec stuff and everyone understands you! I work in a small department, that&#8217;s a big deal to me, one of the other facilitators called it a free therapy session which was funny but pretty accurate. You can gopher whatever the instructor needs during the day and help students with some issues but I had a smaller class so there weren&#8217;t too many technical issues.</p>



<p>I really enjoyed the behind-the-scenes aspect of doing Work Study. One interesting thing that I realized, the surveys are taken very seriously. For anyone who has been to an event, you know you get them for every day of class, every SANS@Night talk, etc, and I just sort of assumed they were all tossed in a box for some later date. Nope, the quality control those is serious. The facilitators take every one, sort them by scores, run them through a spreadsheet, scan every one. Then, every comment is given directly to the instructors after every class and they all go straight to SANS corporate as well. I&#8217;ve never seen a company take then so seriously. But, as someone else at the event mentioned, &#8220;when you pay this much for the training, you want to feel like you are getting the best experience.&#8221; So yes, SANS training isn&#8217;t cheap, at all, but if you can swing it, or are lucky enough to get picked for Work Study, then the quality of the whole event was fantastic.</p>



<p>My 504 class was taught by Kevin Fiscus (https://www.sans.org/instructors/kevin-fiscus), he was a great instructor. It was refreshing to be able to walk up after class and ask about nearly anything security related and to get a useful answer. It shows that the instructors don&#8217;t only know to teach their one course but have a well rounded background and also work in the field. I&#8217;ve taken vendor product training (I&#8217;m looking at you, Cisco!) where the instructor is teaching only to the lab, but even questions like &#8220;well I want to set it up like X&#8221; or &#8220;What if I use the other option on the dashboard instead?&#8221; were usually met with answers telling you to just stick to the lab and it&#8217;ll go fine. As an added bonus for doing Work Study, I also had the OnDemand access included, which was taught by John Strand, the course creator, and it was very helpful to not only get two perspectives on certain topics but be able to refresh on certain topics while creating my test index at home later.</p>



<p>The first day we covered incident response. It seems like a small portion of the class but phases of IR are covered as part of each of the other days through the week by learning how to recognize the tools that attackers will use when you&#8217;re doing IR. This portion of the course covers many areas that many people likely forget in the preparation phase, other departments that you need to involve and even interfacing with law enforcement. One thing they really hit home is the need for management support, this might sound obvious but from a tech side, we see things and might think &#8220;shut it down!&#8221; but in a big corp, that&#8217;s an awesome way to get fired, whether you made the right call or not.</p>



<p>Each day had a number of different labs. Mixed feedback on &#8220;not enough labs!&#8221; to &#8220;labs are awesome!&#8221; came back, so I guess somewhere right around the correct amount of labs. All the full labs come on a USB stick so even if you really break your local environment, you can just extract them again and start fresh. the future labs don&#8217;t rely on the past ones either so restoring is no big deal. I think we&#8217;ve all played around in labs and broken something and then realized we had to rebuild half an AD infrastructure just to run the next command. Pointing out the quality control again, but all the labs just work. I know they&#8217;re <em>supposed</em>&nbsp;to work, but, too many times labs aren&#8217;t perfect. I imagine most people in this field have followed different tutorials, it always seems like the tool has updated, or you&#8217;re missing a dependency, or an exploit doesn&#8217;t have the same options as the screenshots you&#8217;re looking at. None of that going on here. Turns out that&#8217;s why they don&#8217;t use Kali Linux in the image but instead build their own Linux VM loaded with the specific tools and versions that are used in the labs. Kali might update and suddenly you have 30% of the class with essentially a broken lab and now the class is behind.</p>



<p>The one lab we had as part of day 1, but we got to on the morning of day 2, wasn&#8217;t what was we typically think of as a lab. It was a table top exercise. The timing was perfect as I was tasked with doing a table top exercise at work and had already been researching something different for the exercise this year. I had come across the idea a few weeks before the class (https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/dungeons-dragons-meet-cubicles-compromises/) and thought it sounded fun and different but didn&#8217;t imagine doing it in my workplace. So, we did a mock table top in class using that exact same methodology with a bunch of mostly strangers. We didn&#8217;t have a 20 sided die but we used a phone app to do a pseudo-random roll for 1-20. Turns out it was really fun! The idea was that in reality, not everything works perfectly every time without hiccup, because that&#8217;s who real life works.</p>

<p>After that exercise I changed my own table top plan at work and picked up a 55mm die (nothing for scale) that was nice and big so everyone in the room could see it. We had a ransomware exercise and it was great to answer, &#8220;nope, I rolled, you tried to pay it, and failed, so what do we do next?&#8221; I&#8217;m not a D&amp;D guy so I discounted the idea a bit at first but in actual practice it&#8217;s a great way to inject some reality and force people to find workarounds in real time.</p>



<p>The remaining four days covered attacker tools and techniques specifically. Tons of tools, some I&#8217;ve used, some I&#8217;ve never even heard of but all were very cool to see. We followed the whole attack lifecycle from OSINT, recon, scanning, all the way to exploitation and covering your tracks. Again, the labs are really helpful here, you get copies of all of them including video walkthroughs so doing them again at home helps to learn the tools and for test prep.</p>



<p>For day 6, the CTF, that was really a lot of fun. I&#8217;ve done some simple vulnerable VMs before and other labs but never really against someone else in real time. No, I won&#8217;t give tips outside of what I was told which was &#8220;don&#8217;t try to overhack&#8221; aka, don&#8217;t ignore the simple things and try to over-engineer something crazy when there are far faster and easier ways to go about it. Also, bring food, don&#8217;t be the teammate who decides to go out to lunch in the middle of the competition. And, SANS will email and remind you, but if you don&#8217;t have an Ethernet port, bring an adapter with you, or you can&#8217;t participate.</p>



<p>Day 7-8, as our instructor suggested, go home and unplug. Depending on your past experience level you just took in a ton of information and have earned a few days of being lazy!</p>



<p>Now, for the test prep itself. Everyone talks about the index, and the importance is not something you want to ignore. Sure, you are supposed to actually know the material going in, but the depth of some of the questions are definitely something you could be looking up as part of your regular job, the same holds true for the index. I followed Leslie Carhart&#8217;s guide (https://tisiphone.net/2015/08/18/giac-testing/) for index creation, this is just one of many great resources on her blog. The tabs in my books weren&#8217;t such a mess before or during the exam but after passing I stuffed them all back into my bag and happily ate entirely too much and didn&#8217;t unpack them for a few days!</p>



<p>I often see people online asking how long the index is supposed to be, that&#8217;s 100% up to what you need on there and totally personal to your learning style. I saw some people say theirs was 80 pages, others said they had five. Figure out what you need to reference, and the practice tests will help iron out out well your plan works.</p>



<p>I took the first practice exam with made a ton of changes to my index afterwards. I had a feeling when I was creating it that I&#8217;d be looking up terms in different ways, and it was confirmed as soon as I started trying to use it. I made a few more tweaks after the second exam. After all the colors and tabs, I didn&#8217;t end up really referring to them at all, I&#8217;d just grab the right book, then go to the page, but everyone has a different method. The testing center was at a local community college and they gave me a big corner cube with a wrap around desk where I could spread out the books and whiteboard, I couldn&#8217;t have been happier with the setup.</p>



<p>Overall it was a really positive experience. Lots of work but totally worthwhile, if your workplace is understanding (they should be, you&#8217;re getting training to do a better job!) and you have the time and the funds, totally recommended.</p>
