<p>I&#8217;ve had to recreate most of my old blog posts and am doing a static export to github pages, so bear with me here! I was torn on what kind of cheesy hoodie image to use here, so I went full bore and stuck with Hackers the movie. It doesn&#8217;t hold a candle to Sneakers but that&#8217;s a debate for another time.</p>



<p>I took this <a href="https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/network-penetration-testing-ethical-hacking/">SANS SEC560 course</a> in person in NYC in Feb 2020, shortly after the world turned upside down. This review is super delayed, trying to recreate things here and play catch up. It was the last class I was able to take in person, or I guess the last trip of any sort of I took in person minus some family camping. So while it&#8217;s still fresh enough in my head, the last 18 months have felt like 18 years of what we&#8217;ve learned to semi-affectionately call COVID months which have felt somewhere between football minutes and full stoppage of time. </p>



<p>I was able to do this course through the SANS work study program, which I&#8217;ve detailed in my <a href="https://secdan.com/sans-sec504-gcih-class-and-work-study-review/">504 review here</a>, but I really do enjoy. Got to hang out with a lovely group of fellow nerds (and I mean that in the most complimentary way!) and get some much needed social time away from home. None of us realized at the time that we&#8217;d spend most of the next year at home of course. </p>



<p>My instructor was <a href="https://www.sans.org/profiles/jorge-orchilles/">Jorge Orchilles</a> who did a really fantastic job with a very upbeat, energetic teaching style that kept all of us engaged through some long days in class. We had a TA as well, Fred (who I can&#8217;t seem to find an instructor profile for), who swapped spots back and forth with Jorge so we got different perspectives on the same material and the both worked very well together and the feedback throughout the class was overall very positive. One part of doing the work study program involves doing all the ratings and reviews so you get a very first hand read on all the other students&#8217; experiences. </p>



<p>Overall, I really enjoyed the course. There was definitely some overlap in days 1 and 2 with recon and scanning with previous courses but to different degrees. Always good to get a refresh and some different points of view. As it got further into the week with exploitation and pivoting it was all new material which was very interesting content. </p>



<p>I&#8217;m looking over the current day 5 material, it looks like it&#8217;s slightly updated adding content on Azure. I&#8217;d love to have seen some of that in my class too, I can understand why they added it, as I&#8217;m deep into some Azure cleanup and security right now in my job and any material that shows that is helpful.</p>



<p>In true SANS course fashion, the day 6 CTF was a nail biter but a total blast. A group of people I had hung out with a lot, went to dinner with, were all set to have me as part of their CTF team but were full on the last day. Bummer as they were all professional pentesters! Needless to say, they beat everyone else to a well earned challenge coin but we came reasonably close and got to test out a lot of the attacks we had learned about during the week and had a ton of fun in the process. </p>



<p>Shortly after I took this class my workplace had a surprise red team engagement from our parent company. Most of the people involved in the many (MANY!) meetings that came out of that months long engagement really couldn&#8217;t follow most of the findings all that well. I felt this course gave me a much stronger position to understand the attacks, assist in the remediation and even test some of attacks that were used in order to validate that everyone was back in order after.</p>



<p>As I had the OnDemand course access this was really helpful to review everything after. We were in a stressful time right after the class ended and it would have been easy to just push everything to the side and try to focus on things like stockpiling toilet paper and shelf stable foods. It was nice to have a productive distraction then and good reinforcement of all the materials that are fire hosed at you for a week in class. </p>



<p>As I mentioned earlier, shortly after I got home, pretty much everything, everywhere, shut down. So I was unsure how I was going to be able to take my GPEN exam, fortunately within a few months the online proctor testing option became available. I&#8217;ve taken tests like that in college, and even an Azure exam more recently, but nothing where I had a whole stack of books. Definitely a different experience but I was glad to have the opportunity to take the exam even with everything shut down. As always, use your practice tests, they&#8217;re the same style as the real ones and extremely valuable in preparing for your real test. </p>



<p>But, proud to say, even sitting up in my 3rd floor tiny home office &#8220;testing center&#8221; I officially became GPEN certified! </p>



<p> This was an interesting course for me overall as I&#8217;m more a blue teamer than red, but I&#8217;ve been able to take on some purple responsibility at work and that&#8217;s been really satisfying to play a little bit of both. The one difference with this one is day to day I&#8217;m not actively pentesting, but developing the skill further after the class and trying to retain the skillset is definitely something you&#8217;re going to want to do. There are far more red than blue types of online labs so fortunately you don&#8217;t have to search far to find valuable content. </p>



<p>To keep up and later expand the skills I&#8217;d recommend checking out https://tryhackme.com/, they have paths you can follow with tons of content  in all sorts of different areas. Very much worth the $10 a month for a premium subscription. Also, can&#8217;t forget https://www.hackthebox.eu/ as well, they have a VIP subscription and now an academy model too but I don&#8217;t have personal experience with their training side so I can&#8217;t really give input on that one. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I recently was able to take the SANS SEC460 (<a href="https://www.sans.org/course/enterprise-threat-vulnerability-assessment">https://www.sans.org/course/enterprise-threat-vulnerability-assessment</a>) course focused on Threat and Vulnerability Assessment. This is a newer course compared to most of the others that SANS offers so I didn&#8217;t find any actual reviews beforehand other than a friend that did it last year, I figured I&#8217;d throw my opinion out there for what it&#8217;s worth. My workplace has had a slower start in the whole VA space, part of the downside of starting a security department from scratch. We were able to do what was required for compliance and passing audits, but as most people who dig deeper know, there is always a lot more going on than just that. And, as they say in the course, &#8220;if all you&#8217;re doing is running scans and handing over reports you&#8217;re missing most of the vulnerability management process!&#8221;. We already possessed a lot of the tools, but didn&#8217;t really have a solid plan or framework to glue it all together and that was my hope for the course.</p>



<p>I was able to do this course through the SANS Work Study program (<a href="https://www.sans.org/work-study/">https://www.sans.org/work-study/</a>) and as you can see from my previous experience doing the SEC504 class (<a href="https://secdan.com/sans-sec504-gcih-class-and-work-study-review/">https://secdan.com/sans-sec504-gcih-class-and-work-study-review/</a>) I highly recommend this if you can work the schedule and it fits your personality. For me, I love it. The staff was all really friendly and helpful. One of the other facilitators started a chat group while we were there so we were all able to coordinate meals and hanging out which made for a great time and lots of networking too. Overall very positive experience and I look forward to being able to do it again. This course was a reasonable drive away, nice to not have to juggle plane schedules and such, a two hour drive in the morning with no traffic and a bunch of podcasts, not bad at all.</p>



<p>The course was taught by one of the course authors, Adrien de Beaupre (<a href="https://www.sans.org/instructors/adrien-de-beaupre">https://www.sans.org/instructors/adrien-de-beaupre</a>) so there was clearly nothing lost in translation. It&#8217;s a newer course so there isn&#8217;t an OnDemand course for it yet but they were recording that during my session so I&#8217;m sure so of my goofy questions probably make it into the audio somewhere. Adrien describes himself as &#8220;the sarcastic Canadian&#8221;, which works with me. Whoever said sarcasm is the lowest form of humor can.. Well, let&#8217;s say I don&#8217;t agree. Adrien has a ton of real world experience, as I would expect from any SANS instructor, so any questions anyone had along the way here handled easily.</p>



<p>The 460 course is somewhere around a light purple team course. You need to know how to find some holes, and how to fix them. Not as deeply technical as some of the higher level courses that SANS offers but the coursework is fitting for that type of job role. Vulnerability management always seems to fall in different laps ranging anywhere from an auditor asking probing questions to&nbsp; someone else exploiting vulnerabilities to validate their findings. The course gives a good breakdown of the whole process, if you&#8217;re expecting just a class on scanning, then you might be better off with something from your scanner vendor, but if you want to learn the whole process, this one is much more fitting.</p>



<p>SANS has a tendency to avoid focusing on specific vendor tools, because not everyone uses the same tools or can even afford to pay for them. Most management teams wouldn&#8217;t be happy to find you out paid for a course and then you get home and can&#8217;t do anything because the specific tool is out of reach. That logic holds pretty sound here, we used many different tools for scanning and validation from manual checks, to short powershell scripts and some open source tools. The two areas we did use commercial tools were the network and web app scanners. As the instructor said, (obviously paraphrasing) &#8220;we could have had you used OpenVAS, it&#8217;s free, but has everyone really tried scanning 10,000 systems with OpenVAS? You don&#8217;t want to.&#8221; So they settled on Rapid7 Nexpose. I had a bit of an advantage here as I&#8217;ve been using the same tool for years, but at the basic level it&#8217;s also not overly complicated so the instruction that everyone else got didn&#8217;t seem to hold them back at all. For the web application scanning we used Acunetix, I use a different tool at work, but it&#8217;s a web GUI and was pretty straightforward. The bulk of the work in this course is around infrastructure scanning, not web apps. I know there was a question of that during the class, the instruction mentioned they&#8217;re working on a web app version but that course isn&#8217;t available yet. For a lot of the process that you learn, it should be able to be applied to any type of system so it&#8217;s not at all wasted knowledge either way.</p>



<p>The days were laid out logically with the different steps of the whole process, starting with planning and threat modeling all the way through remediation and reporting.</p>



<p>A few ideas really stuck out to me during the course, obvious once you hear them but when you have your company blinders on you tend to forget sometimes:</p>



<ul><li>If you don&#8217;t know have your assets classified, and know what your most high risk systems are, then everything is critical. If you can&#8217;t tell me how important that server is, then I&#8217;m just going to have to safely assume worst case and everything is critical.</li><li>I like to (half-jokingly!) say &#8220;culture&#8221; is like a four letter word sometime. The idea of &#8220;we always did it that way&#8221; can make things like changing big processes and mindsets really complicated. There is definitely a manner in how to best prepare the news and reports of your findings to the different levels of employees. Sr management doesn&#8217;t care about your 1000 page scan report, they want a chart that shows things are getting better, and why. And if they aren&#8217;t, what your plan is to make them better and what help you need to fix that.</li><li>&nbsp;Most people don&#8217;t like to hear their baby is ugly, in the same manner most departments don&#8217;t want to hear the process they&#8217;ve been following is badly flawed. Because of that they will look for anything (ANYTHING!) that is wrong in your report to discount everything you&#8217;re saying. Validation is incredibly important. I once found a subnet that had been ignored for a long time, I scanned it and dropped a report of thousands of critical vulnerabilities on the server team. They checked, found one that was possibly a false positive, they immediately discounted everything in the report, and for quite a few future reports too. My thought process was along the lines of … what even 80% of it is wrong, so you only have hundreds of really terrible things that are publicly accessible?? Their translation was &#8220;we found a mistake, your tool is garbage&#8221;. Don&#8217;t be the boy that cried wolf, some things are going to be missed, but do some basic checks to make sure you are providing valid data.</li></ul>



<p>On the end of the 5th day we had much lighter lab day and took the last part of the day to get familiar with the NetWars engine. I learned a few things, don&#8217;t rush, wrong answers because you moved too quickly don&#8217;t help you when others have hours to catch up. I answered the sample ones very quickly, whoo I&#8217;m a the top.. Oh wait, they&#8217;re catching up! I&#8217;m pretty competitive by nature, blame a large family where if you don&#8217;t move quick you lose out on dinner! So I wanted to win and it almost bit me in the rear by rushing too much.</p>



<p>The 6th day was all a special version of NetWars CTF for the course. This was really a lot of fun, you got to use most of the different tools and ideas from the course and some were definitely tricky. Our team had a quick lead but (not my fault I learned my lesson the day before!) but there was definitely some messy guessing going on so we lost a few points to that. And, like the day before the other teams caught up. It got down to just one question at the end and with four people on the team, two of us wanted one answer the other two wanted another one. We couldn&#8217;t get it wrong, luck (and a fair bit of experience with the type of system in question) was on my side and we put in our final answer with just five minutes left and won by a single point. Big nail biter finish there, but we pulled it out and took home the challenge coin!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://secdan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/460coin3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-55" width="444" height="418" srcset="https://secdan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/460coin3.png 888w, https://secdan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/460coin3-300x282.png 300w, https://secdan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/460coin3-768x722.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 444px) 100vw, 444px" /></figure>



<p>The timing was perfect, if not even a month or so late for me, as soon as I got back to the office I found our our internal audit and an outside firm are going to be auditing our whole vulnerability process. I wish I had even a bit more time to implement some of the things I learned but I now have a really good roadmap for the future at my workplace and it should be significantly more advanced than just handing over scan reports.</p>



<p>Overall the class was really enjoyable and recommended if this is your area. The course prerequisites are pretty general but I&#8217;d suggest a pretty comfortable knowledge of the Windows command line, how to at least get around in a Linux shell and&nbsp; basic understanding of Powershell. I know there isn&#8217;t a lot of complicated Powershell used, but some people had never even seen the verb-noun type logic or the concept of loops so it was likely harder for them.</p>



<p><del>I can&#8217;t do an exam review on this one as the exam isn&#8217;t written yet. Hopefully it doesn&#8217;t take too long and I can take a shot at it soon!</del></p>



<p>Edit &#8211; GEVA exam is now live. I took the exam as one of the early testers. It was definitely a different experience taking it months after the course without having access to the OnDemand as I did in the past as a refresher. But, like before I dug into the books and labs, all the information is in there. I created an index and tuned it after taking my practice tests to clean up areas I felt weaker in. I got my same great, roomy cornet seat in the testing area so I could spread out all my stuff and knocked it out!</p>



<p>As an exam tester you have to wait until the exam is actually going live to get the results, for me,&nbsp; that was a few months process but I tried to forget about it so I didn&#8217;t obsess about it. Right at the time we were told the results would be out, I got the email that I passed. Well, I got two emails, one saying I got the GEVA certification and a second saying I scored high enough to be invited to the SANS Advisory Board!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Phishing is a thing most of us are painfully familiar with day to day. It&#8217;s fairly well understood to be the easiest and most common path to a breach. So why is it so easy? It&#8217;s simple, people don&#8217;t pay attention to what they&#8217;re doing most of work day. Is that to say that very complex phishing attempts would fool almost anyone? Of course they would, but, I&#8217;ve been doing phishing testing at my company for the last few years and in practice it&#8217;s far less complex than most people realize.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve worked with a few phishing testing and awareness training vendors, I have books on game theory and social engineering. But, I could make a simple email with the wrong company domain, with a giant tag across the top of the email saying &#8220;This is from external contact, please be cautious of clicking links or opening attachment, WARNING!!&#8221; and fill the body out with a misspelled request to validate your password at crapsite.co.com.xxx.guru/fake-password-stealer.html and I&#8217;ll still get 10%+ of the users handing over their passwords within an hour. Insert mental image of me facepalming myself at my desk here.</p>



<p>They all get awareness training, we run testing campaigns with education, we have security awareness week with fun prizes. But, once they&#8217;re out of that bubble, it&#8217;s a click party. Even following up with reports from our email security provider for phishing that does get through you can ask the users and they&#8217;ll say, &#8220;but that&#8217;s a vendor of mine&#8221;. When you pull up the email, it&#8217;s nothing close to anyone they deal with, doesn&#8217;t matter, clicking anyway.</p>



<p>Considering you might really only need one person to click and give away credentials / load your malware / etc, how do you really solve this? If I knew how to get this number down to zero without smashing email servers with a hammer I wouldn&#8217;t be writing a blog post, I&#8217;d be swimming in my Scrooge McDuck money bin.</p>



<p>How about aiming a little lower? While it pains me to write that, understand it&#8217;s never going to be perfect and just aim for better than yesterday, and eventually, not worse than yesterday. There are some technical controls, but as long as users can get emails from outside, you&#8217;re likely going to deal with this problem, forget it coming from a real vendor that has been compromised, that&#8217;s another ball of wax entirely.</p>



<p>Ideas that have been helpful for me:</p>



<ul><li>Banners for external mail</li><li>More training</li><li>Sharing stories of actual cases</li><li>Simply the reporting process</li><li>Positive reinforcement</li><li>Consequences</li></ul>



<p>A little more detail on the above ideas:</p>



<ul><li>Banners for external mail &#8211; I touched on this earlier but basically have any email that isn&#8217;t sourced internally from your domain to be tagged with some sort of obvious external tag. Will some people ignore it? Sure they will, but some won&#8217;t, and if you solve a little bit at a time it does add up.</li><li>More training &#8211; Training needs to be interesting and engaging, if all the users have to do is click next 5x and they&#8217;re done for the year. If that&#8217;s the case you might pass compliance but you&#8217;re no more secure than you were before the training.</li><li>Sharing stories of actual cases &#8211; This one didn&#8217;t even occur to me until I was running a tabletop exercise recently and someone from outside IT had the suggestion. They felt through the tabletop they were learning so much and had no idea how real the threats were. Make the stories somewhat generic if you need to so people don&#8217;t get mocked, and don&#8217;t be afraid to share good stories of users catching crafty emails. Everyone loves a pat on the back, we did this recently and sent out a company-wide email newsletter with details and got a lot of positive feedback.</li><li>Simplifying the reporting process &#8211; If a user has a questionable email, how hard is it for them to ask for some help? If they have to call up and admit they made a mistake they are less likely to do it. If they email it to the help desk and never hear back, expect them to never do it again. Many phishing providers (they are also free ones out there) make buttons for most email clients that allow users a one button click to send an email in to be inspected. Bonus points if they click it during a real phishing test and it doesn&#8217;t bother creating the ticket and congratulates the user for a good catch.</li><li>Positive reinforcement &#8211; There is a bit of this sprinkled into the earlier suggestions. But, if people know they can come to you, even if they&#8217;ve clicked and think they&#8217;ve done something wrong, it&#8217;s going to go a lot further in building a relationship and having them learn the right thing than just yelling at them for mistakes. Some people use different types of rewards, know your own company and market and figure out what works, but even just thanking people for reporting issues can work wonders.</li><li>Consequences &#8211; More in the stick than the carrot category, hash consequences for your actions. Not really my favorite way to approach it, but if I have someone who has done training repeatedly, been talked to, explained how it all works and still clicks on everything that is put in front of them, then sometimes you have to work your way up the org chart a bit. I once saw another business unit&#8217;s HR staff fell for a phish and sent all their employee&#8217;s W2s out via email. The user was fired. I found out and immediately went to &#8220;was she trained?&#8221; or even &#8220;why was the email able to be spoofed and passed through?&#8221; line of thought. Extreme consequence, but you can bet that every other person in that department was hawk eyed afterwards. Not my preferred method but that one was far out of my hands.</li></ul>



<p>I think with any testing you should start simple and grow towards way more complicated with time. Anyone can design a perfect phish that will work on exactly who you target. But, is there a point of it being too difficult? That&#8217;s hard to say, but we recently switched phishing providers and they wanted to do a baseline test. As part of this test they got our internal domain spoofed, which we block normally anyway, and a whitelist which bypassed the external banners. Not surprisingly they got a higher than normal click rate. But, they tweaked the controls enough to present something to the users that normally wasn&#8217;t even possible. They were trained to look at the real domain, the external banner, etc, they did that correctly and then were informed they were wrong. Thankfully that was just a small test and we were able to revert the changes and go for a close lookalike domain and put the banner back on. The results were lower, not as low as I&#8217;d like, but at least controlling the situation got a more predictable result.</p>



<p>I was once told by an old Cisco SE about an internal phishing test that got him, and I can&#8217;t blame him. He was at work, shopping on Amazon and purchased something. Seconds after the purchase he got a purchase confirmation email from Amazon. They were monitoring the network for specific traffic and triggering phishing emails to those users based on that. He had clicked on the email before it even registered that his work email wasn&#8217;t his registered Amazon account address. But, in a situation like this, just playing the odds, it could happen anyway that you&#8217;ll have a user at a giant corp shopping Amazon at the moment. A few years back I sent out a phishing test email with one of the &#8220;You hit your email quota, click here to increase your mailbox size and continue getting email&#8221; sort of message. It was sent to maybe 6000 users, two of them had actually put in requests to have their real mailbox size increased already and were waiting for the update. You can bet they clicked that link the second that test showed up, I had no idea it would work out that way, but it doesn&#8217;t seem all that unlikely.</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t updated in a while, but I wanted to focus on knocking out the GCIH after the course and had a ton of other things going on, so, here you go. I&#8217;ll try to make up for it with an annoying amount of detail.</p>



<p>The SANS SEC504 &#8211;&nbsp;Hacker Tools, Techniques, Exploits, and Incident Handling (https://www.sans.org/course/hacker-techniques-exploits-incident-handling) is the most recent SANS course I&#8217;ve taken, and the first time I&#8217;ve taken one in person. Drinking from the firehose in person is very different from watching the OnDemand at home, overall great experience.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m in no way a stranger to different types of education. I&#8217;ve done a bunch of classes in different topics, have a BS, a few classes into an MS, have done a pile of self-study certifications, and nothing compared to the experience of a 6 days on-site SANS course. Let&#8217;s just say I slept well that week!</p>



<p>Taking a few steps back, I work in infosec and my department is not exactly what I would consider well-staffed. Because of that, I (along with many others in my field I&#8217;m sure) have to wear many different hats. Incident response is just one of the tasks that is on my plate and what I&#8217;ve done so far has been just what seemed like a logical process. I&#8217;ve heard John Strand mention the PICERLL model many times on podcasts but didn&#8217;t spend a lot of time digging into it otherwise. Most of my experience is on the blue team side so this class was right down my alley!</p>



<p>My current workplace is pretty free with training time, but, training funds&#8230; not so much. Because of that I&#8217;ve been applying to the SANS Work Study program (https://www.sans.org/work-study/) and this was the first time the event date, class and location all worked together and I was all in. For those not familiar with the program, you essentially agree to work the live event as a facilitator in exchange for a huge discount on the training and exam. You show up a day or so early, do a bunch of setup, bundle together training materials, get promotional stuff ready. But overall, it was nice just hanging out with people in the field, talking about nerdy infosec stuff and everyone understands you! I work in a small department, that&#8217;s a big deal to me, one of the other facilitators called it a free therapy session which was funny but pretty accurate. You can gopher whatever the instructor needs during the day and help students with some issues but I had a smaller class so there weren&#8217;t too many technical issues.</p>



<p>I really enjoyed the behind-the-scenes aspect of doing Work Study. One interesting thing that I realized, the surveys are taken very seriously. For anyone who has been to an event, you know you get them for every day of class, every SANS@Night talk, etc, and I just sort of assumed they were all tossed in a box for some later date. Nope, the quality control those is serious. The facilitators take every one, sort them by scores, run them through a spreadsheet, scan every one. Then, every comment is given directly to the instructors after every class and they all go straight to SANS corporate as well. I&#8217;ve never seen a company take then so seriously. But, as someone else at the event mentioned, &#8220;when you pay this much for the training, you want to feel like you are getting the best experience.&#8221; So yes, SANS training isn&#8217;t cheap, at all, but if you can swing it, or are lucky enough to get picked for Work Study, then the quality of the whole event was fantastic.</p>



<p>My 504 class was taught by Kevin Fiscus (https://www.sans.org/instructors/kevin-fiscus), he was a great instructor. It was refreshing to be able to walk up after class and ask about nearly anything security related and to get a useful answer. It shows that the instructors don&#8217;t only know to teach their one course but have a well rounded background and also work in the field. I&#8217;ve taken vendor product training (I&#8217;m looking at you, Cisco!) where the instructor is teaching only to the lab, but even questions like &#8220;well I want to set it up like X&#8221; or &#8220;What if I use the other option on the dashboard instead?&#8221; were usually met with answers telling you to just stick to the lab and it&#8217;ll go fine. As an added bonus for doing Work Study, I also had the OnDemand access included, which was taught by John Strand, the course creator, and it was very helpful to not only get two perspectives on certain topics but be able to refresh on certain topics while creating my test index at home later.</p>



<p>The first day we covered incident response. It seems like a small portion of the class but phases of IR are covered as part of each of the other days through the week by learning how to recognize the tools that attackers will use when you&#8217;re doing IR. This portion of the course covers many areas that many people likely forget in the preparation phase, other departments that you need to involve and even interfacing with law enforcement. One thing they really hit home is the need for management support, this might sound obvious but from a tech side, we see things and might think &#8220;shut it down!&#8221; but in a big corp, that&#8217;s an awesome way to get fired, whether you made the right call or not.</p>



<p>Each day had a number of different labs. Mixed feedback on &#8220;not enough labs!&#8221; to &#8220;labs are awesome!&#8221; came back, so I guess somewhere right around the correct amount of labs. All the full labs come on a USB stick so even if you really break your local environment, you can just extract them again and start fresh. the future labs don&#8217;t rely on the past ones either so restoring is no big deal. I think we&#8217;ve all played around in labs and broken something and then realized we had to rebuild half an AD infrastructure just to run the next command. Pointing out the quality control again, but all the labs just work. I know they&#8217;re <em>supposed</em>&nbsp;to work, but, too many times labs aren&#8217;t perfect. I imagine most people in this field have followed different tutorials, it always seems like the tool has updated, or you&#8217;re missing a dependency, or an exploit doesn&#8217;t have the same options as the screenshots you&#8217;re looking at. None of that going on here. Turns out that&#8217;s why they don&#8217;t use Kali Linux in the image but instead build their own Linux VM loaded with the specific tools and versions that are used in the labs. Kali might update and suddenly you have 30% of the class with essentially a broken lab and now the class is behind.</p>



<p>The one lab we had as part of day 1, but we got to on the morning of day 2, wasn&#8217;t what was we typically think of as a lab. It was a table top exercise. The timing was perfect as I was tasked with doing a table top exercise at work and had already been researching something different for the exercise this year. I had come across the idea a few weeks before the class (https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/dungeons-dragons-meet-cubicles-compromises/) and thought it sounded fun and different but didn&#8217;t imagine doing it in my workplace. So, we did a mock table top in class using that exact same methodology with a bunch of mostly strangers. We didn&#8217;t have a 20 sided die but we used a phone app to do a pseudo-random roll for 1-20. Turns out it was really fun! The idea was that in reality, not everything works perfectly every time without hiccup, because that&#8217;s who real life works.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://secdanhome.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/img_20180924_075951-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-40" width="456" height="423"/></figure></div>



<p>After that exercise I changed my own table top plan at work and picked up a 55mm die (nothing for scale) that was nice and big so everyone in the room could see it. We had a ransomware exercise and it was great to answer, &#8220;nope, I rolled, you tried to pay it, and failed, so what do we do next?&#8221; I&#8217;m not a D&amp;D guy so I discounted the idea a bit at first but in actual practice it&#8217;s a great way to inject some reality and force people to find workarounds in real time.</p>



<p>The remaining four days covered attacker tools and techniques specifically. Tons of tools, some I&#8217;ve used, some I&#8217;ve never even heard of but all were very cool to see. We followed the whole attack lifecycle from OSINT, recon, scanning, all the way to exploitation and covering your tracks. Again, the labs are really helpful here, you get copies of all of them including video walkthroughs so doing them again at home helps to learn the tools and for test prep.</p>



<p>For day 6, the CTF, that was really a lot of fun. I&#8217;ve done some simple vulnerable VMs before and other labs but never really against someone else in real time. No, I won&#8217;t give tips outside of what I was told which was &#8220;don&#8217;t try to overhack&#8221; aka, don&#8217;t ignore the simple things and try to over-engineer something crazy when there are far faster and easier ways to go about it. Also, bring food, don&#8217;t be the teammate who decides to go out to lunch in the middle of the competition. And, SANS will email and remind you, but if you don&#8217;t have an Ethernet port, bring an adapter with you, or you can&#8217;t participate.</p>



<p>Day 7-8, as our instructor suggested, go home and unplug. Depending on your past experience level you just took in a ton of information and have earned a few days of being lazy!</p>



<p>Now, for the test prep itself. Everyone talks about the index, and the importance is not something you want to ignore. Sure, you are supposed to actually know the material going in, but the depth of some of the questions are definitely something you could be looking up as part of your regular job, the same holds true for the index. I followed Leslie Carhart&#8217;s guide (https://tisiphone.net/2015/08/18/giac-testing/) for index creation, this is just one of many great resources on her blog. The tabs in my books weren&#8217;t such a mess before or during the exam but after passing I stuffed them all back into my bag and happily ate entirely too much and didn&#8217;t unpack them for a few days!</p>



<p>I often see people online asking how long the index is supposed to be, that&#8217;s 100% up to what you need on there and totally personal to your learning style. I saw some people say theirs was 80 pages, others said they had five. Figure out what you need to reference, and the practice tests will help iron out out well your plan works.</p>



<p>I took the first practice exam with made a ton of changes to my index afterwards. I had a feeling when I was creating it that I&#8217;d be looking up terms in different ways, and it was confirmed as soon as I started trying to use it. I made a few more tweaks after the second exam. After all the colors and tabs, I didn&#8217;t end up really referring to them at all, I&#8217;d just grab the right book, then go to the page, but everyone has a different method. The testing center was at a local community college and they gave me a big corner cube with a wrap around desk where I could spread out the books and whiteboard, I couldn&#8217;t have been happier with the setup.</p>



<p>Overall it was a really positive experience. Lots of work but totally worthwhile, if your workplace is understanding (they should be, you&#8217;re getting training to do a better job!) and you have the time and the funds, totally recommended.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Many of us are drawn to security because it changes all the time and there is never a shortage of new findings. The upside, is also the downside, it changes all the time. I know I read something a few years ago that someone searched all the top&nbsp;infosec&nbsp;news sources and&nbsp;came to the conclusion&nbsp;that you could read all of them, every day, and you would literally not be enough hours in the day to do it. I can’t find the reference but even if it’s just an urban myth, I doubt any of us have the time to know everything, about everything, all the time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I know most of us aren’t crazy about the idea of named vulnerabilities, logos, website and general malware marketing. But, I doubt it’s just me, it does help get a lot more traction in getting things fixed at work. Telling another group their systems are vulnerable to CVE-2018-X might be ignored, but when their manager hears they are vulnerable to&nbsp;Spectre/Heartbleed/etc&nbsp;that they’ve heard about on the news, well now that sounds important and they’re willing to&nbsp;take action.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A few years&nbsp;ago&nbsp;I was interviewing and got down to the final stage. A week before Shellshock was all over the news (see, malware marketing!). I sat&nbsp;down&nbsp;and the hiring manager said, “soo… anything interesting related to security that you’ve heard about lately?” I told him about what was going on and he breathed a huge sigh of relief. He shared with me that every other finalist they brought in didn’t have a clue what he was talking about. I’m not referring to just the nerd news either, this was all over major news networks and these people were all already working in&nbsp;infosec. The hiring manager felt that if the other candidates didn’t bother learning about big public security news they surely weren’t going to bother keeping informed if they worked there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’ve asked this sort of question of every potential hire for our security department. I’m always surprised by how many people say they don’t bother following any websites, twitter or email lists at all. They just wait for a vendor to email them if there is a vulnerability, which seems crazy to me. I know not everyone is going to be a con presenter, but at least show interest in your profession.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With that in mind, I’m always looking for ways to consolidate the news / alerts parts of my day. I do enjoy my work and check these things for fun too but like I said earlier, there are so many free hours in the day. Here are some of the ways that I do that:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Podcasts – I have an old iPod in the car loaded with security podcasts. I know most people would probably just use their phone, it’s mostly habit and it’s always charged, I’ll get around to being more modern with that eventually. (Edit &#8211; shortly after this I went to using my phone like everyone else in the world) Every commute back and forth to work or just driving around town I have some nerdy learning sort of broadcast in the background. The specific ones are personal preference, but I typically get an extra hour+ a day of security info on commuting days. There are general security podcasts (Security Weekly has a few different flavors now and frequently has SANS instructors on there, very interesting), Offensive specific, social engineering specific, almost anything you might be interested in there is probably someone talking about it that you can learn from. </p>



<p>Twitter – I’m a twitter lurker, I admit I almost never really interact there except for liking/sharing posts or emailing myself links to dig into later. But, you can bet when new things are breaking that a ton of security folks that I follow all start retweeting and it’s not long before it’s a notification on my phone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Websites / Forums – There are a ton of security news websites, this can be like a black hole. I highly suggest a news RSS reader, like&nbsp;feedly, you can add any site that interests you and check them all from one spot. That doesn’t exactly cut down the results but at least it centralizes it. For forums, I read a few but special shout out to reddit. I’ve seen many security topics break there, with great interaction from the readers, there is lots of junk there but if you focus on technical subreddits it’s very solid and totally worth your time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Email – I know getting news via email sounds weird if you’re thinking breaking news, but vendor announcements are typically done that way. I also get a daily email from the&nbsp;CyberWire, they consolidate a lot of the top security news stories for the day and give a quick couple paragraph breakdown for the overall news and links to all the trending stories. On days when I’m head down busy I still try to make time at the end of the day to scan that email to see if anything crazy happened that I missed. Highly recommended.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, sadly I can’t make the day longer than 24 hours, but at least try to use the time you do have productively.</p>
